# nn-maker
nn-maker will be a simple library created to help with creating deep neural networks.
## Things already done
- [x] poor parameters initialization (prone to vanishing/exploding gradients)
## Things to do
- [ ] preventing parameters initialization from vanishing/exploding gradients
- [ ] cost function 
- [ ] regularization: L2
- [ ] regularization: inverted-dropout
- [ ] forward and backpropagation
- [ ] implementing Adam optimizer
- [ ] additional customizable options, e.g. own choice of optimizer

#### Expected finish date:  6-7.08.2019
