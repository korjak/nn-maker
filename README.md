# nn-maker
nn-maker will be a simple library created to help with creating deep neural networks.
## Things already done
- [x] parameters initialization, partly immune to vanishing/exploding gradients
- [x] cost function
- [x] forward and backpropagation
## Things to do
- [ ] regularization: L2
- [ ] regularization: inverted-dropout
- [ ] implementing Adam optimizer
- [ ] additional customizable options, e.g. own choice of optimizer

#### Expected finish date:  17-18.08.2019
